# fb-capture
Just my own personal convenience tweaks to fetching the Linux framebuffer to bitmap files.

It's not really any more useful than sophisticated solutions like [FBGrab](http://fbgrab.monells.se/) which have been around for years by now and offer much more flexibility, but for my own reasons I needed to create my own solution for immediately giving me the screen capture from the terminal graphics buffer.

The last time I made such a utility for myself, I accidentally deleted the source code to it and lost the correct functionality of the binary I was using.  Just figured that this time if I put it up on GitHub, I won't lose it. :)
